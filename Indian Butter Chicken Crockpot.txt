Indian Butter Chicken - Crockpot
2-3 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs (mine were frozen solid)
1 onion, diced
6 garlic cloves, minced
4-6 T butter (depending on how much chicken you used)
15 cardamom pods (sewn together, in a cheesecloth, or in a tea bag…)
2 tsp curry
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
2 tsp garam masala
little pinch  ground ginger
1 14.5 oz  can coconut milk
1 6 oz. can tomato paste
1 T apple cider vinegar
The Process:
Plop your chicken in your crockpot.  Depending on the ratio of sauce to chicken you’re looking for, use somewhere between two and three pounds.  I use closer to three pounds.
Add all other ingredients to the crockpot and using a rubber spatula, kind of push them around until they are sort of mixed together.  Carefully add your cardmom pods at the end and submerge them in some of the liquid, in between some chicken thighs.
Cook on LOW for 8 hours or HIGH for 4-5 hours, until chicken is thoroughly cooked.  Discard cardamom pods.  Using two forks, shred your chicken thighs and let the meat soak up a bit more of the liquid.
